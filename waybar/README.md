### My Waybar config

****

# This has been moved to my big config repo. 

## Overview

This is my waybar config for Hyprland and/or other Wayland-based WMs/DEs, heavily modified from [Mechabar](https://github.com/sejjy/mechabar). It uses Nerd Fonts and rofi to display icons and UI elements, and has a dark mode aesthetic. 

## Installation

1. Remove existing config from waybar to prevent conflicts. 
2. Copy the contents of `waybar/` to `~/.config/waybar` or wherever your waybar config is stored. 
3. Next, install rofi and merge the contents of `rofi/` with your rofi config at `~/.config/rofi`. This provides all the menus for waybar.
